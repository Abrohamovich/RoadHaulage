# Road Haulage

Imagine that you are travelling from Odessa to Kiev, your car is half empty, and you are thinking:
â€˜How could you make some money in the process?

Our project is a platform where everyone can become a courier or find a person
who will transport cargo along the necessary route.
It is a place where people with empty boots find those who are looking for a
convenient and economical way to send a parcel, things, or even a small cargo.
